Entity usually represents a unique object in your application model schema with which you are trying to faithfully capture the reality.

The easiest entity can be a simple class with properties that represents a single table record in database for example.

~~~ php
/**
 * @mapper Database(table_name)
 *
 * @property integer  $id        m:primary
 * @property string   $username
 * @property DateTime $createdOn
 */
class User extends \UniMapper\Entity
{}
~~~

### Supported types

**Basic** `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `double`, `array`

**[DateTime](http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php)**

**Entity** Single entity, named according to your [naming conventions]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/reference/naming-conventions/)

**Entity\[\]** Entity collection as `UniMapper\EntityCollection`

### Primary property
Very important is `m:primary` as [primary property](#primary-property), because it represents some kind of *foreign key* similar to relational database and every entity can be identified by it. Usually some `id` column in your database for example.

### Mapping
You can tell entity how to map your data.

~~~ php
/**
 * @adapter MyAdapter(table_name)
 *
 * @property integer $id   m:primary
 * @property string  $text m:map(text_column_name)
 */
class MyEntity extends \UniMapper\Entity
{}
~~~

### Property validators
Built your own validation logic on every property. You only need to add `m:validate` filter with validation rule and define the corresponding function like `validationRuleName($value)`.

See the example below.

~~~ php
/**
 * @property integer $score m:validate(score)
 */
class User extends \UniMapper\Entity
{
    public static function validateScore($value)
    {
         return $value >= 1 && $value <= 5;
    }
}

$user = new User;
$user->score = 1 // OK
$user->score = 6 // Throws exception
~~~

> Tip! You can even define multiple rules `m:validate(rule1|rule2...)`. Each rule must be met.

There are also some built-in rules: `url`, `email`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`.

### Computed property
A kind of virtual property, mostly dependent on other real properties so it is readonly and can not be set directly. It can be helpful in situations like price computing for example.

~~~ php
/**
 * @property double $price
 */
class Product extends \UniMapper\Entity
{}

/**
 * @property Product[] $products
 * @property double    $price    m:computed
 */
class Order extends \UniMapper\Entity
{
    protected function computePrice()
    {
    	$price = 0;
    	foreach ($this->products as $product) {
    	    $price += $product->price;
    	}
        return $price;
    }
}

$order = new Order;
$product1 = new Product;
$product1->price = 5.0;
$order->products[] = $product1;
echo $order->price; // Will be 5.0

$product2 = new Product;
$product2->price = 10.0;
$order->products[] = $product2;
echo $order->price; // Will be 15.0
~~~

> Remember! Computed property can not be mixed with other filters.

### Entity inheritance
You can even extend entity with a new one. All properties will be inherited too. Just write a {@inheritdoc}.

~~~ php
/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 *
 * @property string $fullName
 */
class UserDetail extends User
{}
~~~
