## Requirements

<a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> 5.4+

## Composer

The best way to use this library in your project is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) with all those nice things it provides.

~~~ shell
composer require unimapper/unimapper@dev
~~~

## Manually

But you can still download it [manually](http://github.com/unimapper/unimapper/archive/master.zip) and load required classes via `./src/loader.php`.
